## Overview of Surf's Up Analysis

### Purpose
Used Python, Pandas functions and methods, and SQLAlchemy to assess the following data to make recommendations about the sustainability of opening a year-round surf shop in Oahu.
* Provide weather summary statistics for June
* Provide weather summary statistics for December

Provided the following:

1. Dataframe and summary statistics for June temperatures

## Surf's Up Results

Three key differences in the weather between June and December are:
1. The average temperature is 74.9 degrees in June and 71.0 degrees in December
2. The 75th percentile temperature is 77.0 degrees in June and 74.0 degrees in December
3. The lowest temperature recorded is 64.0 degrees in June and 56.0 degrees in December
4. The highest temperature recorded is 85.0 degrees in June and 83.0 degrees in December

### Summary Conclusions:
High Level Summary: The similarity of the 75th percentile temperatures in June and December suggest that this location is sustainable for year-round operations.
